# The Precepts

### Precept 35

> _Up is Up, Down is Down._ If you fall over in the darkness, it can be easy to lose your bearing and forget which way is up. Keep this Precept in mind!

The `up` direction is noted with "Up" and the `down` direction is noted with
"Down", so you always know which way is which.
